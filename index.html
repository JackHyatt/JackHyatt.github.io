                    <p>
                        Our users are struggling with finding drinks to suit their tastes while developing healthy drinking habits. Most people may spend a significant amount of time trying different alcoholic beverages before they find a drink that attains both their ideal flavor and alcohol by volume. We seek to ease this process by matching oneâ€™s tastes with numerous options to choose from, while also making sure they are aware of how the drinks will affect them in both small and large numbers.
